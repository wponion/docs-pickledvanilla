# PickledVanilla

## What is it & Why Another Library

PickledVanilla is an absurdly small jQuery alternative for modern browsers \(IE11+\) that provides jQuery-style syntax for manipulating the DOM. Utilizing modern browser features to minimize the codebase, developers can use the familiar chainable methods at a fraction of the file size. 100% feature parity with jQuery isn't a goal, but PickledVanilla comes helpfully close, covering most day to day use cases.

Well as a web developer i wanted to move out from jQuery and use Vanilla JS when i realized it i found that i had to repeate few lins of code every time i need to do some actions. so instead i just created as a library.
